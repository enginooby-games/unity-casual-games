PACK: Human Paperdoll

--

Pixel-art sprites pack depicting a composite Human Paperdoll character, including a simple set of clothes and backwear. You can use it as a paperdoll in character customization menus, use the art for a physics ragdoll or generally create poses for ingame billboards or what have you.

--

Drawn with a '32 pixels per meter' scale. Rough estimate, not meticulous accuracy, stylized intentionally to be slightly cartoony to make head large enough to clearly show visible facial features at such a small scale.

--

By default in image import settings, all sprites/textures have been set to 32 pixels per unit and using a point filter so they appear crisp.
